# Collocations

Python scripts for finding the most common collocations in a text.

`get_collocations27.py` runs in Python 2.7, and `get_collocations3.py` runs in Python 3.

Part of "Collocations Analysis: A Hands-On Workshop," which I ran with Matthew Lavin at the University of Pittsburgh on April 7, 2017.
